# Initial Try

In the `Student.java` file, can you add class variables for `isLearner` (a `boolean`) and `hasGraduated` (also a `boolean`). Set `isLearner` to an initial value of `true` and `hasGraduated` to an initial value of `false`.

For each of these class variables, add `static` methods for accessing and modifying them.

Additionally, incorporate them into a `toString` method for the class. You can decide what other information could be included in a `toString` method for a `Student`, but it must include the values of these two new class variables.

When done correctly, the `TestStudent.java` file should have no errors and produces the following output when run:

```
true
false
[Some string you made up!]

false
true
[Some slightly different string you made up!]
```
