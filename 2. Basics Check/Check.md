# Basics Check

In the `Teacher.java` file, can you add class variables for `isCertified` (a `boolean`) and `minAge` (an `int`). Set `isCertified` to an initial value of `true` and `minAge` to an initial value of `21`.

For each of these class variables, add `static` methods for accessing and modifying them.

Additionally, incorporate them into a `toString` method for the class. You can decide what other information could be included in a `toString` method for a `Teacher`, but it must include the values of these two new class variables.

When done correctly, the `TestTeacher.java` file should have no errors and produces the following output when run:

```
true
21
[Some string you made up!]

false
22
[Some slightly different string you made up!]
```
